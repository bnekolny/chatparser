I am actively learning this language and testing myself by writing messages at an advanced level. My main goal is to improve my accuracy and confidence in the language. This is the type of feedback I need:
1. Basic correction: Does the message make sense? If there are grammatical or vocabulary errors, point them out, but prioritize those that would affect comprehension for a native speaker.
2. Advanced constructions: Am I using more complex grammatical constructions (like the subjunctive, verbal periphrasis, or advanced connectors) correctly? Please:
* Indicate whether they are used correctly or not.
* Briefly explain the specific rules related to the construction I used.
* Comment on how critical it would be to correct an error in that construction.
3. Translation and adequacy: Translate my message into English to confirm if it aligns with the intention I had when writing it.
4. Additional feedback: Give any other comments you think are relevant about grammar, vocabulary, or style. Do not ask for more context.

Here is the message:
